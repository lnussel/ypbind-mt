ypbind-mt is a complete new implementation of a NIS binding daemon for
Linux. It has the following features:

	* Supports ypbind protocol V1, V2, V3.

	* IPv6 support (needs TI-RPC and libnsl! Else use old 1.x version).

	* Uses threads for better response.

	* Supports multiple domain bindings.

	* Supports a list of known secure NIS server (/etc/yp.conf)


The following features against version 1.x were dropped:

	* Listen to DBUS/NetworkManager.
	* Use SLP to find a running ypserv

WARNING: 
--------
If the system's DNS names are used in the NIS configuration, this
hostnames needs to be resolveable without NIS. If NIS is used, the
NIS clients need to query the NIS server to resolve the hostname of
the NIS server, this is a classical endless recursion and will only
lead to a crash of the system.
This worked with the old protocoll, since the protocol did only allow
one IPv4 address, so ypbind did use DNS (independent of what is
configured in /etc/nsswitch.conf) to resolve the name and store the
first IPv4 address.
