Things to do (in no particular order):

	* Check all 5-15 min. if the current ypserv is really the
	  fastest.

	* A ypserv host could have multiple interfaces

	* Try to reconfigure the host search order for other libraries
	  then glibc (like Solaris, Linux libc5, Linux libc5+NYS)

	* Fix the stupid yp.conf parser

	* Write a better parser for yp.conf

	* Use getopt_long_only for parsing options
